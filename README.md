# Randomizer App
An app I created for my friends for choosing random activities from a given list. 

Features:
* Create Catagories and add activities to them
* Delete Catagories or individual activities
* Roll for a random activity in a catagory and re-roll if you want another activity instead
* Has dark mode & light mode (WIP design)

Data for categories is saved with txt files. 
To launch the app, simply open the Randomizer.py file in src
